<!-- This file demonstrates online visual odometry. The graph optimization backend 
     is only used to combine the motione estimates to several predecessor frames 

     The visual odometry will be sent as the frame "/vodom" on the "/tf" topic.
     
     To get the cloud, you can subscribe to the online_cloud_out_topic (subsampled
     according to cloud_creation_skip_step or to the original point cloud from the 
     openni driver.
